Lab 3 - Flexbox
The goal of this lab is to help familiarise yourself with flexbox. In this lab we will be using functional CSS which in a nutshell is very easy, e.g. m-20 class will correspond to margin with value 20 units and mt will correspond to margin-top with value 20 units.


1. Familiarize with provided classes and HTML
2. Basic flexbox
    2.1. FIll in .flex-container class and add `display: flex;` to it
    2.2 Fill in flex-item-1,2,3,4 classes and set `flex: <number>` on them
    2.3 How does the value for the flex affect the size of the item?
3. Flex center
    3.1 Edit flex-center content and set values for justify-content and align-items
    3.2 Try out different values for both CSS rules. Your final goal is to center item within its container both horizontally and vertically
4. Spacing elements on the opposites sites
    4.1 Edit flex-space-between class and set appropriate justify-content to space elements on the opposite sites
5. Wrapping items
   5.1 fill in the rule for flex-basis-50 and flex-wrap so the container has `flex-wrap: wrap;` and flex items have flex-basis set to 50%
6. Try changing flex-direction or using different values for flexbox containers and items. Use the reference below to find some of the commonly used values.
