Use the learnings from this lesson to design some very simple functions.

Create 4 functions for the 4 main mathematical operations (-,+,/,*). Return the
value and output it to the screen.

Create a function that takes the name of a person as an argument, and prints
out “Hello Name”to the console. Hint: search online on how to concatenate two
strings.
