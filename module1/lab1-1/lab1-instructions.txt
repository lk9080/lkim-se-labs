This is the lab 1-1

You have been hired by devsInc to create a landing page for their
new project. They want to support people playing tabletop games
from home and require a Dice Generator.
Features:
The user should be able to use different dice, such as a D6 or a D10
(number of faces).



Define on paper, all the use cases (functionalities) you will need
for this page.
• Make a simple storyboard of the user using the system.
• Create a git branch for the project in the main repository
• Work on the project creating 3 files, one for the UI, one for the styling one for the JS to roll the dice 
• Create the roll functionality by passing an argument, in order to
reutilise the same function multiple times
• Write a test for the roll dice functionality.
• When complete, push the content to your git branch.
