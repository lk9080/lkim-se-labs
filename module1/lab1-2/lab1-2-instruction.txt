Learning to code is just one step, to make people know that you
know how to code will make a difference. Artists have Pinterest,
makers have Etsy, we have GitHub, that is where our name will
appear, and the first web site most people will google when they’ll
want to hire us. GitHub offers the possibility to create your own page,
so let’s make use of it!
• Simply follow the instructions here to create your first page, follow
this https://pages.github.com/ and use what you have learned to
make your portfolio site! Maybe it will not look great today, but
one day it will!
• Here are some ideas if you need them.
